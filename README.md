# Play Store Data Analysis

The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to 
drive app-making businesses to success. Actionable 
insights can be drawn for developers to work on and 
capture the Android market. So in this project our objective is to
thoroughly analyse , explore and generate insights from our data so to
find out what are those major key factors that decides an appâ€™s success
and engagement rate on google play store.


## Install

This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [Wordcloud](https://pypi.org/project/wordcloud/)

We also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

We can install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) distribution of python
which already has most of the above packages and more included or we can also run the 
whole notebook on google colab without going through the process of installing all the
libraries locally in our machine.


## Code

The main code is provided in the `Play_Store_App_Data_Analysis.ipynb`
notebook file. We will also require the two datasets
`Play Store data.csv` and `User Reviews.csv` to run the
notebook. An interactive dashboard created on the same datasets
can also be accessed by going to the link 
[Play Store Apps Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/shaurabh.pandey/viz/PlayStoreDashboard_16661280481130/Dashboard1?publish=yes)
## Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory (that contains this README) 
and run one of the following commands:

```
ipython notebook Play_Store_App_Data_Analysis.ipnyb
```
or
```
jupyter notebook Play_Store_App_Data_Analysis.ipnyb
```
or open with Jupyter Lab
```
jupyter lab
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project
file in our browser
## Data

`User Reviews.csv` . The Play Store dataset consists of
